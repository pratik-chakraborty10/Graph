## Introduction

A graph is a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. It's a powerful data structure used in many applications where relationships between entities need to be represented. This Java Graph Data Structure allows you to create, manipulate, and analyze graphs.

## Features

- Support for directed and undirected graphs.
- Add, remove, and search for nodes and edges.
- Find the neighbors of a node.
- Calculate the degree of a node.
- Check for the existence of a path between two nodes.
- Depth-First and Breadth-First traversal algorithms.
- Highly customizable with the ability to use custom data types as node values.

## Usage

1. **Creating a Graph:**

   You can create a graph by instantiating the `Graph` class.

   ```java
   Graph<String> graph = new Graph<>();
   ```

2. **Adding Nodes and Edges:**

   You can add nodes and edges to the graph using the `addNode` and `addEdge` methods.

   ```java
   graph.addNode("A");
   graph.addNode("B");
   graph.addEdge("A", "B");
   ```

3. **Removing Nodes and Edges:**

   To remove nodes and edges, you can use the `removeNode` and `removeEdge` methods.

   ```java
   graph.removeNode("A");
   graph.removeEdge("B", "C");
   ```

4. **Searching for Nodes and Edges:**

   You can search for nodes and edges in the graph using the `hasNode` and `hasEdge` methods.

   ```java
   boolean hasNode = graph.hasNode("A");
   boolean hasEdge = graph.hasEdge("B", "C");
   ```

5. **Traversing the Graph:**

   You can traverse the graph using various algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

   ```java
   List<String> dfsTraversal = graph.depthFirstTraversal("A");
   List<String> bfsTraversal = graph.breadthFirstTraversal("A");
   ```

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating the usage of this Java Graph Data Structure:

```java
Graph<String> socialNetwork = new Graph<>();

socialNetwork.addNode("Alice");
socialNetwork.addNode("Bob");
socialNetwork.addNode("Charlie");

socialNetwork.addEdge("Alice", "Bob");
socialNetwork.addEdge("Bob", "Charlie");

boolean hasConnection = socialNetwork.hasEdge("Alice", "Charlie");

List<String> friendsOfAlice = socialNetwork.getNeighbors("Alice");

System.out.println("Alice's friends: " + friendsOfAlice);
System.out.println("Is there a connection between Alice and Charlie? " + hasConnection);
```
